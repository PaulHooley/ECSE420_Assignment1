2.1) There are 4 conditions that could cause a deadlock, first is mutual exclusion, a process requires exclusive control of its resources. Second is the concept of hold and wait, where the process must hold its resources while waiting to get others. Third is no preemption, where much like hold and wait the process will not give up its resources until it is finished with it. Lastly, circular wait must be present so that each process in a chain holds the resources that the next one requires.

2.2) There are a few common strategies to deal with deadlocks. Since all 4 of the above conditions must be true for a deadlock to occur, all we have to do is ensure one of them is prevented. Firstly, we could disallow mutual exclusion. Secondly we could stop the hold and wait by blocking the process until all resources are available. We add preemption by forcing a process to release all resources that it's holding if it cannot get all that it needs, and then request at a later time. Lastly we can prevent circular wait by defining a linear ordering of resource types.

3.2) To avoid deadlock, we need to prevent one of the four necessary conditions that can allow deadlock to occur. In our approach, we disallow the circular wait condition by having one of the philosophers pick up the right chopstick first instead of the left one. In our implementation we made the first philosopherpick up their chopsticks in reverse order. This avoids the situation where each philosopher picks up the chopstick to their left, causing deadlock.

3.3) To avoid starvation, we modified our implementation from part 3.2 to use Semaphores instead of Objects for the chopsticks. One of the constructors for the Java Semaphore class accepts a `fair` argument, which specifies if the Semaphore will guarantee FIFO granting of permits under contention. This way, each chopstick is granted in a fair way and the philosopher that has waited longest will be granted the chopstick, preventing starvation.
