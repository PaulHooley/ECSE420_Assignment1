2.1) There are 4 conditions that could cause a deadlock, first is mutual exclusion, a process requires exclusive control of its resources. Secondly is the concept of hold and wait, the precess may wait for recouses while holding onto others. No preemption, much like hold and wait the process will not give up its resources until it is finished with it. Lastly, circular wait must be present, so that each process in a chain holds the resources that the next one requires.

2.2) There are a few common strategies to deal with deadlocks. Since all 4 of the above conditions must be true for a deadlock to occur, all we have to do is ensure one of them is halted. Firstly we can disallow mutual exclusion. Secondly we stop the hold and wait by blocking the process untill all recources are available. We can stop preemption by forcing a process to release all resources that it's holding if it cannot get all that it needs, and then request at a later time. Lastly we can prevent circular wait by defining a linear order of resource types.
